<h2>EARLY LIFE OF THE SAVIOR.</h2>

<p>Nearly six thousand years ago the first man
and the first woman were formed, out of the dust
of the ground. Their names were Adam and
Eve. They were placed in a very pleasant and
beautiful garden, called Eden, where they had
every thing they could wish; and were permitted
by God to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the
garden, except one.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One tree that in the midst was placed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">God bade them not to take;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ah! the fruit they dared to taste,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And his commandment break."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In an evil hour they listened to the temptations
of the serpent&mdash;the great enemy of mankind&mdash;and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
ate of the forbidden fruit. Then God was
angry with them, and sent his Angel to drive
them out of the garden, to a place where thorns
and thistles covered the ground, and they were
obliged to work hard for a living. God cursed
the ground for their sake, but at the same time
he promised that "the seed of the woman should
bruise the serpent's head."</p>

<p>This promise was fulfilled by Jesus Christ, the
Son of God, who came into the world and suffered
and died to save men from the consequences of
the first man's disobedience. I will now tell
you something about this wonderful event.</p>

<p>A little more than eighteen hundred years ago,
as some shepherds were taking care of their
sheep by night on the hills of Palestine, an angel
of the Lord came to them, and the glory of
the Lord shone round about them: and they
were very much afraid. But the angel told them
not to fear, for he brought them good news:
"For unto you is born this day, in the city of
David, a Savior which is Christ the Lord."</p>

<p>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of the heavenly host, praising God, and
saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace, good will towards men."</p>

<p>As soon as the angels were gone, the shepherds
went to Bethlehem, to see the Savior that God
had so wonderfully made known to them. They
found his reputed father with his mother, Mary,
and the babe lying in a manger: "because there
was no room for him in the inn." The shepherds
then went to their homes praising God,
and telling every one they saw of the new-born
Savior.</p>

<p>Sometime afterwards, a wonderful star was
seen by some wise men in the country east of
Judea; and they concluded that it must be a sign
that the long expected Messiah was born. They
therefore went at once to Jerusalem, where they
inquired for the "king of the Jews," stating that
they had seen his star in the east, and were come
to worship him.</p>

<p>Herod was the king of Judea at this time: and
when he heard of the new king, he was very
much troubled, and the people were also troubled,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
not knowing what to expect. Herod made
particular inquires about the place where it was
expected Christ would be born: and when he
found that it was at Bethlehem, he sent the wise
men there, telling them to bring him word when
they had found him, that he might go and worship
him too.</p>

<p>So the wise men went to Bethlehem: and the
star which they had seen in the east went before
them till it came and stood over the place where
the infant Savior was. They were glad when
they saw this: and when they came into the
house and found Jesus and his mother, they fell
down on their faces and worshiped him. Then
they made him many presents of money, and
rich spices which were found in their country.</p>

<p>When the wise men were ready to return, the
angel of the Lord appeared to them, and told
them not to go back to Herod, as he had directed.
So they went to their home by another
way. The angel also appeared in a dream to
Joseph, and told him to take the child and his
mother, and flee into Egypt; and Joseph did as
the angel had said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
    Herod was a cruel, wicked man, and was afraid
if Jesus grew up, he would be king of the Jews
instead of him; so he intended to kill him while
a little child. But when he found the wise men
would not tell him where to find him, he sent his
soldiers to Bethlehem, and ordered them to kill all
the children under two years old, hoping in this
way to come at Jesus: but the Lord had before
provided for his safety, by sending him to Egypt.</p>

<p>When Herod was dead, Jesus returned with
his parents from Egypt, and went to live in the
city of Nazareth. Joseph was a carpenter, and
we are told that when Jesus was old enough he
worked with him at the same trade. The Bible
tells us he grew in stature, and in favor both
with God and man: and that he lived with his
parents, and was subject to them, or did as they
wished to have him. Thus he set an example
of obedience to parents which every child should
follow.</p>

<p>When he was twelve years old, he went with
them to Jerusalem to the feast of the passover;
and after the close of the ceremonies, when
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
they were going home, they found Jesus was
not with them. So they returned to look for
him and found him in the temple sitting in the
midst of the learned men, hearing them and
asking them questions; so that they were astonished
at his knowledge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
    <a name="p010-illus.jpg" id="p010-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p010-illus.jpg" width="350" height="246" alt="Jesus and his mother in a temple" title="" />
</div>

<p>When his mother told him they had been
looking for him, sorrowing, he replied, "How
is it that ye sought me? Knew ye not that I
must be about my Father's business?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
    There was a law among the Jews that no one
should be a public teacher, or minister, till he
was thirty years old. Jesus wished to show respect
to the laws of his country, and therefore
we may suppose he continued to work as a carpenter
till he was of that age. He was then
baptized in the river Jordan by his forerunner,
John the Baptist, and commenced choosing his
disciples and preaching the gospel.</p>

<p>The story of his life after this time,&mdash;how he
went about teaching the people, though they
often abused him; how he gave them food when
they were hungry, though he had not where to
lay his head, healed the sick, and in every way
returned good for evil to his ungrateful countrymen,
for three years, till they cruelly put him to
death,&mdash;is told at large in the New Testament,
where we hope all our young readers will read
it again and again, with earnest attention. They
will find it a very interesting narrative, and in
it instructions capable of making them wise unto
salvation.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<h2>CRUCIFIXION OF OUR SAVIOR.</h2>

<p>Our blessed Savior, having passed a life of
piety and virtue, amply illustrated by the doctrines
he had taught and practised, and the
benefits rendered mankind, was at length betrayed
by Judas Iscariot into the hands of the
Jewish High Priest and Council, whose hatred
and malice against him were without bounds,
as the truths he had proclaimed were but faithful
commentaries on the vice and wickedness
of their own characters.</p>

<p>He was tried and condemned&mdash;though his
judge declared that he found no fault in him,&mdash;his
body mangled with whips, and a wreath of
thorns pressed upon his head as a mock crown.
They spit upon him, taunted him, smote him on
the crown with staves, that it might wound the
more deeply, till his head, face, and body were
bathed in blood.</p>

<p>In this situation, condemned and abandoned
by the world he came to save, the heavy cross
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
was laid upon his shoulders, and he was conducted
in public through the city.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
    <a name="p013-illus.jpg" id="p013-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p013-illus.jpg" width="350" height="239" alt="The crucifixion" title="" />
</div>

<p>Passing the gates, he was brought to a place
called Golgotha and Calvary, the place of execution
for the city. His clothes were then stripped
off, his body stretched out, and his hands
and his feet nailed to the cross, which was then
lifted up. Over his head the inscription was
placed by Pilate, "<span class="smcap">Jesus of Nazareth the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
King of the Jews</span>," in three different languages,
Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, in order that
strangers might know for what he suffered. With
this inscription the Jews were offended, and wished
it altered. But Pilate replied that what he
had written should stand good.</p>

<p>While our Savior hung thus languishing in
torment on the cross, the multitude around
strove to add to his misery by reviling speeches
and horrid blasphemies. Some nodded their
heads and cried, "If you be the Son of God,
come down from the cross." The priests and
rulers scoffed in like manner, "He saved others,
but himself he cannot save." The blessed Savior
replied not, but lifted up his eyes and prayed
for his enemies, "Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do."</p>

<p>Nay, even one of the thieves who were crucified,
one on each side of him, derided and urged
him to save himself and them, if he was the
Messiah. But his fellow criminal acknowledging
the justice of their condemnation, and the entire
innocence of Christ, seriously rebuked him,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and looking upon Jesus with humble reliance,
cried "Lord remember me when thou comest into
thy kingdom." The Lord rewarded his great
faith, embraced him with the arms of mercy,
and assured him, that "that very day he should
be with him in Paradise."</p>

<p>His mortal agonies became now unutterable.
His enemies still mocked him with their bitter
taunts and revilings; they gave him vinegar to
allay his burning thirst. He tasted thereof, and
feeling the pangs of death, he cried, "all is accomplished.&mdash;Father,
into thy hands I commend
my spirit;" and meekly bowing his head, he
expired.</p>

<p>His death was accompanied by a terrible
earthquake. Rocks were shattered, graves
were opened, and the veil of the temple torn in
two parts. In short, the whole face of nature
seemed changed. The sun was so shadowed
that the stars appeared. The eclipse was awful,
and the miraculous darkness universal, having
been recorded by many even of the Pagan
writers. It continued for three hours, during
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
which time all things were full of terror.&mdash;Many
who saw and heard were converted, and cried
"Truly this is the Son of God."</p>

<p>The body of our Savior having been buried,
by one of his friends, in a new tomb hewn out
of a rock, the Jews and rulers went to Pilate
and told him, that this impostor having declared
within his life time that he would rise again within
three days, they wished the sepulchre kept
under a strong guard until the third day, lest his
disciples should come by night and steal the
body, and then persuade the people that he had
risen from the dead. They procured the desired
guard, and secured the tomb, setting a seal
upon the stone. Vain precaution!&mdash;The prophecy
was fulfilled. The Savior burst from the
tomb, and rose triumphant to the bosom of his
Father which is in heaven.</p>


<hr />
<h2>THE GREAT COMMISSION.</h2>

<p>After the resurrection of our Savior, he appeared
several times to his disciples. He
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
strengthened them in the walk of faith; enlarged
their power and commission; declaring to
them, that all power was given to him in heaven
and earth. Therefore he commanded them to
go through all the world, and preach the Gospel
to every creature, baptizing them in the name
of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
and teaching them to observe all things that he
had commanded them. Adding further&mdash;that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
he that believed and was baptized should be
saved, but he that believed not should be damned.
He promised them his continual protection&mdash;that
he would be ever present with them, even
to the end of the world.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
    <a name="p017-illus.jpg" id="p017-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p017-illus.jpg" width="350" height="242" alt="Jesus and the disciples" title="" />
</div>

<p>On his last appearance to the apostles he particularly
commanded them, that they should not
depart from Jerusalem till they had received the
promise of God, and were invested with power
from above. That after the descent of the Holy
Ghost upon them they should have sufficient
power and knowledge, and have the honor of
being his witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea,
in Samaria, and in the farthest parts of the earth.</p>

<p>He then led them out of the city to that part
of Mount Olivet which was near Bethany, where,
lifting up his hands which showed the marks of
his sufferings, he gave them his last benediction.</p>

<p>And while they were all in the posture of adoration,
he was parted from them by degrees, taken
up in a cloud, and carried triumphantly into
the ineffable glories of heaven.</p>

<h2>STEPHEN</h2>

<p>Was chosen one of the first deacons of the
Christian Church at Jerusalem. He was of high
report for wisdom, and the endowments of the
Holy Spirit. He confuted the most learned Jews
in their arguments, and applied such wholesome
truths to the test of their consciences, that being
sorely galled, and unable to answer, their rage
was unbounded.</p>

<p>Stephen, however, regarded them not, but
fixing his ardent gaze upward, was ravished
with the vision of glory revealed to him, and
declared that he saw the heavens opened, and
the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.</p>

<p>This farther enraged his enemies, who resolved
to deal with him as a blasphemer; and,
therefore they raised a great noise and clamor,
stopped their ears to hear no cries for mercy,
and rushing upon him, they hurried him out of
the city in order to stone him, according to an
ancient law against blasphemers.</p>

</div>

<p>The witnesses, according to custom, stripped
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
themselves, and then began the tragedy, which
was soon seconded by the multitude. During
all this, the pious martyr was on his knees praying
to God, and earnestly interceding for his
murderers, "that he would not charge this guilt
upon them"&mdash;till at length he fell asleep in the
arms of death, being the first martyr who suffered
in the Christian Church, A. D. 34.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<h2>SAUL OF TARSUS, OR PAUL.</h2>

<p>This great agent in the first persecution of
the Church of God was well educated in the
learning of the times, and one of the most strict
of the sect of the Pharisees. He was born in
the Roman city Tarsus, and enjoyed the privilege
of a free citizen of Rome, which gave him
high influence among the Jews, and increased
his power to injure the followers of Jesus. He
pursued the Christians with the fury of a bigot
and the rage of a madman. He paid no regard
to age or sex; tearing the husband from the wife,
and the mother from her children, and breathing
vengeance and blood wherever he came.</p>

<p>But at last it pleased God, A. D. 35, to put a
stop to his violence and wickedness. And wonderful
was the change of his heart. Having
dispersed the Christians from Jerusalem, he was
on a journey to renew his persecutions in Damascus,
when a sudden light from heaven smote
him to the ground, and he heard a voice, "Saul,
Saul, why dost thou persecute me?" The haughty
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Saul trembled, his conscience smote him, his
soul was humbled, and his feelings melted for
the cause he had heretofore hated and persecuted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
    <a name="p022-illus.jpg" id="p022-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p022-illus.jpg" width="350" height="232" alt="The light forced him to the ground" title="" />
</div>

<p>Saul became now, after this miraculous conversion,
one of the strongest pillars of the Christian
Church. He preached the gospel in public,
laboring with pious zeal as if to make up for the
guilt and crimes of his former life.</p>

<p>Thousands were converted by his preaching,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and he endured the persecutions of the unbelieving,
remembering when he too was a leader
among them.</p>

<p>He was stoned at Lystra, A. D. 46, and left
for dead,&mdash;but suddenly revived as the disciples
were attending upon his body. Having thus
escaped the fate of Stephen, he travelled on
from city to city, openly proclaiming the Gospel.</p>

<p>At length after a long life spent in fearless devotion
to the cause of the crucified Savior, he
was taken up in Rome, thrown into prison, and
in a few months after, condemned to suffer martyrdom
by beheading, A. D. 68.</p>


<hr />
<h2>LUKE.</h2>

<p>This apostle and Evangelist, was the companion
and assistant of Paul, who calls him "the
beloved Physician." After the death of Paul,
he preached the gospel with great success in
Egypt and Lybia, and also in Italy and Macedonia.
As to his death, there are different accounts.
Yet the best writers say he suffered
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
martyrdom in Greece. A party of infidels there
made head against him, and drew him to execution.
For the want of a cross, they hung him
upon an olive tree. He was in the <a name="the" id="the"></a>eighty-fourth
year of his age at the time of his death, A. D.
74. His gospel was written, while he was in
company with Paul, A. D. 61&mdash;13 years before
his martyrdom, and 28 years after the ascension
of our Lord.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
